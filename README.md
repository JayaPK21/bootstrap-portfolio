# Portfolio Landing Page

## Description

This project is for recreating an existing portfolio page (which was built without any frameworks) using bootstrap components. The page has been built using many different bootstrap components and classes and customizing them according to the requirements. Website is already made responsive by using bootstrap and there was no need of using any media queries.

The following list describes the different sections of the portfolio page:

* Top of the page consists of my full name and my profile picture with some navigation links. These links can be used to go directly to different sections of my web page.

* First section is the 'Work' section which displays a list of all my web development work in the form of cards. Bootstrap cards have been used to contain a brief information about each deployed web application. A link to the deployed application has also been provided in the form of buttons.

* Followed by the work section is the skills section which displays the skills set in the form of a list.

* The last is the 'About Me' and 'Contact' sections. They are for containing a brief introduction about myself and my contact details.

* The phone number and email id text can be easily selected with one click to copy to clipboard and be used.

* Footer sections contains links to my LinkedIn and Github profiles.

* The 'Resume' button in the footer section is used to download my latest Resume.
